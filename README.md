# repositoryKeeperFrontEnd
This is a simple ReactJS application that enables interaction with a server Rest API.
The main feature is to allocate github projects in a backend application.
This simple project is part of the RocketSeat Bootcamp which I am enrolled. 

To run
- Download by using HTTP or SSH.
- Run yarn install to install dependencies
- Run yarn start to enable starting.
- It is necessary to download the server which is also in here by the name RepositoryKeeper.
